## 1.10.0 (Unreleased)

UPGRADE NOTES:

* Using the `ghcr.io/opentofu/opentofu` image as a base image for custom images is no longer supported. Please see https://opentofu.org/docs/intro/install/docker/ for instructions on building your own image.

NEW FEATURES:

- New builtin provider functions added ([#2306](https://github.com/opentofu/opentofu/pull/2306)) :
  - `provider::terraform::decode_tfvars` - Decode a TFVars file content into an object.
  - `provider::terraform::encode_tfvars` - Encode an object into a string with the same format as a TFVars file.
  - `provider::terraform::encode_expr` - Encode an arbitrary expression into a string with valid OpenTofu syntax.

ENHANCEMENTS:
* OpenTofu will now recommend using `-exclude` instead of `-target`, when possible, in the error messages about unknown values in `count` and `for_each` arguments, thereby providing a more definitive workaround. ([#2154](https://github.com/opentofu/opentofu/pull/2154))
* State encryption now supports using external programs as key providers. Additionally, the PBKDF2 key provider now supports chaining via the `chain` parameter. ([#2023](https://github.com/opentofu/opentofu/pull/2023))

BUG FIXES:

- Fixed an issue where an invalid provider name in the `provider_meta` block would crash OpenTofu rather than report an error ([#2347](https://github.com/opentofu/opentofu/pull/2347))
