# Use OpenTofu as Docker Image

OpenTofu is available as [OCI container images](https://github.com/opentofu/opentofu/pkgs/container/opentofu),
and distributed via public GitHub Packages registry.

## Versions

Images are hosted as packages in the OpenTofu GitHub organization. See the list
of available versions [here](https://github.com/opentofu/opentofu/pkgs/container/opentofu/versions?filters%5Bversion_type%5D=tagged).

The multi platform images are available using the following tags:

- `latest`: latest overall version of OpenTofu,
- `Major`: a specific major version of OpenTofu,
- `Major`.`Minor`: a specific minor version of OpenTofu,
- `Major`.`Minor`.`Patch`: a specific patch version of OpenTofu.

To pull platform-specific images (`amd64`, `arm`, `arm64`, `386`) use:

- `<Version>`-`<Platform>`: a platform specific version of OpenTofu.

## Usage

To pull the image from GitHub Packages registry:

<CodeBlock language="bash">{DockerPullScript}</CodeBlock>

To run OpenTofu as a Docker container:

<CodeBlock language="bash">{DockerRunScript}</CodeBlock>
